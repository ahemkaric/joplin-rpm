  <summary>A free and secure notebook application.</summary>

  <description>
    <p>Joplin is a free and secure notebook application. Organization is easy using
notebooks and tags which can all be synchronized between your various devices.
The notes are can be searched, copied, tagged, and modified either from the
applications directly or from your own favorite text editor. The notes are
composed with the ever-popular and familiar markdown format.</p>

    <p>Notes can be imported from Evernote, to include all associated resources
(images, attachments, etc) and all metadata (geo-location, update time,
creation time, etc). Notes can, of course, also be imported from any other
markdown source.</p>

    <p>Mirroring to your devices and redundancy is achieved by a simple—and
optionally end-to-end encrypted—synchronization to various cloud services including
Nextcloud, Dropbox, Onedrive, WebDAV, or your local or network-accessible file
system.</p>

    <release version="1.0.216" date="2020-05-24">
      <url>https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.216</url>
      <description>
        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>This release includes a rewrite of the note editor component in order to allow further improvements (which were no longer possible) and to make it easier to maintain both WYSIWYG editors and regular editor.</p>
        <p>A new button "Code View" has been added to switch between the WYSIWYG editor and the Markdown editor.</p>
        <p>The note-specific toolbar has also been moved next to the title field for now because it wasn't practical to leave it with the editor-specific toolbar (and also not logical). It might be tweaked or moved later on once we have a clearer idea of what we want to do.</p>
        <p>Finally, the tag bar has been moved to the top of the note editor pane. Again this was in part necessary after the refactoring, but also more logical since the tags are relevant to the note, but not to the note content. So it makes more sense to have the editor toolbar right next to the editor content, without the tag bar in between, as before.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New: Add + to access 'Zoom In', allows to use the numpad (#2630 by Helmut K. C. Tessarek)</li>
          <li>New: Add option to "Reveal file in folder" when right-clicking on image</li>
